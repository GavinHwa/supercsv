<h1>Speed of Super CSV</h1>


Speed is a relative thing, depending on the underlying hardware, the current load of the system etc. We compare SuperCSV's speed relative to
reading a file line by line and doing a <tt>split(",")</tt> on each line. While this comparison is not completely sound as a simple split does not
 encompass the complexities of CSV parsing it indicates the overhead of CSV procesing.





<h2>Reading speed</h2>

<table cellspacing="8">
<tr><th>Method</th><th>Relative speed</th><th>Average execution time</th></tr>
<tr><td>split()</td><td>100,00%</td><td>0,37</td></tr>
<tr><td>ListReader</td><td>338,92%</td><td>1,24</td></tr>
<tr><td>MapReader</td><td>424,24%</td><td>1,55</td></tr>
<tr><td>BeanReader</td><td>481,00%</td><td>1,76</td></tr>
<tr><td>BeanReader (full)</td><td>1003,66%</td><td>3,68</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The test implementation can be found in class <tt>ReadingSpeedTest.java</tt> in the source folder. The test generate a csv file consisting of
 250.000 lines each with 6 columns of random size representing numbers, names and dates. The generated file is approximately 7.6 MB.
The file is then read 5 times for each reading strategy used. The tests were conducted
a slow 1800 Dell with 500 MB ram (of which 472 were in use upon testing).
<p>
The conclusion of the tests are that SuperCSV is only 3-5 times slower than a native read with a simple (insufficient) processing of data.
Processing 1/4 of a million lines
takes less than 2 seconds (the BeanReader). The two seconds encompasses reading the file, parsing the lines, instantiating a bean instance
and populate the fields (as strings) using the bean's set-methods.  The last row in the table (BeanReader full) is special in the sense,
that on top of reading lines, creating objects and populating fields, it converts two columns on each lines into long's and one column into a date.
<p>
Putting these figures into perspective, I once was hired to fix a business application that spent 16 hours processing a CSV file of around 50.000 lines.
So if your application is running slow, I dare say that it is unlikely due to using SuperCSV!
